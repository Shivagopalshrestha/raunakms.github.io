Standard treatment of PeM is limited to cytoreductive surgery and/or chemotherapy, and no effective targeted therapies for PeM exist. Some immune checkpoint inhibitor studies of mesothelioma have found positivity to be associated with a worse prognosis. To search for novel therapeutic targets for PeM, we performed a comprehensive integrative multi-omics analysis of the genome, transcriptome, and proteome of 19 treatment-naive PeM, and in particular we examined BAP1 mutation and copy-number status and its relationship to immune checkpoint inhibitor activation. We found that PeM could be divided into tumors with an inflammatory tumor microenvironment and those without, and that this distinction correlated with haploinsufficiency of BAP1. To further investigate the role of BAP1, we used our recently developed cancer driver gene prioritization algorithm, HITnDRIVE, and observed that PeM with BAP1 haploinsufficiency form a distinct molecular subtype characterized by distinct gene expression patterns of chromatin remodeling, DNA repair pathways, and immune checkpoint receptor activation. We demonstrate that this subtype is correlated with an inflammatory tumor microenvironment and thus is a candidate for immune checkpoint blockade therapies. Our findings reveal BAP1 to be a potential, easily trackable prognostic and predictive biomarker for PeM immunotherapy that refines PeM disease classification. BAP1 stratification may improve drug response rates in ongoing phase-I and II clinical trials exploring the use of immune checkpoint blockade therapies in PeM in which BAP1 status is not considered. This integrated molecular characterization provides a comprehensive foundation for improved management of a subset of PeM patients.","tags":null,"title":"BAP1 Haploinsufficiency Predicts a Distinct Immunogenic Class of Malignant Peritoneal Mesothelioma","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Hodzic E","**Shrestha R$^*$**","Zhu K","Cheng K","Collins CC","SC Sahinalp","**$^*$As joint first author**"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1517529600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1517529600,"objectID":"67f57d6e5c574485ce4aadd7a7217c82","permalink":"http://raunakms.github.io/publication/2018_cdcap/","publishdate":"2018-02-02T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2018_cdcap/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Combinatorial Detection of Conserved Alteration Patterns for Identifying Cancer Subnetworks","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yamada M","Tang J","Lugo-Martinez J","Hodzic E","**Shrestha R**","Saha A","Ouyang H","Yin D","Mamitsuka H","Sahinalp C","Radivojac P","Menczer F","Chang Y"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1515398400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1515398400,"objectID":"e098ba55dfd99acd030be3ecb2272fb2","permalink":"http://raunakms.github.io/publication/2018_featureselection/","publishdate":"2018-01-08T00:00:00-08:00","relpermalink":"/publication/2018_featureselection/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Ultra High-Dimensional Nonlinear Feature Selection for Big Biological Data","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Feng Y","Ren S","**Shrestha R**","Bell R","Volik S","Cox M","Sharifi-Noghabi H","Zhou J","Jun W","Li Y","Jian W","Wang Y","Sun Y","Collins CC"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1514764800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1514764800,"objectID":"14c88dffb41b482011f056f49533ae49","permalink":"http://raunakms.github.io/publication/2018_prostatemicrobiome/","publishdate":"2018-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2018_prostatemicrobiome/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Metagenomic and metatranscriptomic analysis of human prostate microbiota from patients with prostate cancer","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"I will be giving a talk at the Terry Fox Research Institute 8th Annual Scientific Meeting (ASM).

Here we introduce HIT'nDRIVE, a computational method that integrates genomic and transcriptomic data to identify a set of patient-specific, sequence-altered genes, with sufficient collective influence over dysregulated transcripts. HIT'nDRIVE aims to solve the **random walk facility location (RWFL)** problem in a gene (or protein) interaction network, which differs from the standard facility location problem by its use of an alternative distance measure: **multi-hitting time**, the expected length of the shortest random walk from any one of the set of sequence-altered genes to an expression-altered target gene. When applied to 2200 tumors from four major cancer types, HIT'nDRIVE revealed many potentially clinically actionable driver genes. We also demonstrated that it is possible to perform accurate phenotype prediction for tumor samples by only using HIT'nDRIVE seeded driver gene modules from gene interaction networks. In addition, we identified a number of breast cancer subtype-specific driver modules that are associated with patients' survival outcome. Furthermore, HIT'nDRIVE, when applied to a large panel of pan-cancer cell-lines, accurately predicted drug efficacy using the driver genes and their seeded gene modules. Overall, HIT'nDRIVE may help clinicians contextualize massive multi-omics data in therapeutic decision making, enabling widespread implementation of precision oncology.","tags":null,"title":"HIT'nDRIVE: Patient-Specific Multi-Driver Gene Prioritization for Precision Oncology","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1487352600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1487352600,"objectID":"9f972da2fef7b7c2504a10fd461d63f8","permalink":"http://raunakms.github.io/talk/20170217_terryfox/","publishdate":"2017-02-17T09:30:00-08:00","relpermalink":"/talk/20170217_terryfox/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Translating Big-Data to Precision Oncology","type":"talk"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1478221200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1478221200,"objectID":"806c18087bdf403409af2a7223857d77","permalink":"http://raunakms.github.io/talk/20161103_vanbug/","publishdate":"2016-11-03T18:00:00-07:00","relpermalink":"/talk/20161103_vanbug/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"HIT'nDRIVE: Patient-Specific Multi-Driver Gene Prioritization for Precision Oncology","type":"talk"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1476806400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1476806400,"objectID":"8827ac6c4c703fa1c21703de2786a71d","permalink":"http://raunakms.github.io/talk/20161018_ashg/","publishdate":"2016-10-18T09:00:00-07:00","relpermalink":"/talk/20161018_ashg/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"ASHG-2016","type":"talk"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1475510400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1475510400,"objectID":"13e328420320f5b82402bd94d9f08781","permalink":"http://raunakms.github.io/talk/20161003_giw/","publishdate":"2016-10-03T09:00:00-07:00","relpermalink":"/talk/20161003_giw/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"HIT'nDRIVE: Patient-Specific Multi-Driver Gene Prioritization for Precision Oncology","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Luk I","**Shrestha R**","Xue H","Wang Y","Zhang F","Lin D","Haegert A","Wu R","Dong X","Collins CC","Zoubeidi A","Gleave ME","Gout PW","Wang Y"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1474614000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1474614000,"objectID":"76d9847c9264e4c7e51195c46c2ac9ff","permalink":"http://raunakms.github.io/publication/2016_birc6/","publishdate":"2016-09-23T00:00:00-07:00","relpermalink":"/publication/2016_birc6/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"BIRC6-targeting as potential therapy for advanced, enzalutamide-resistant prostate cancer","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.

Here, I attempt to demonstrate how this can be achieved using R.\nLoad required libraries library(\u0026quot;stringr\u0026quot;) library(\u0026quot;igraph\u0026quot;) library(\u0026quot;RColorBrewer\u0026quot;) library(\u0026quot;gplots\u0026quot;) library(\u0026quot;cluster\u0026quot;)  Load input data file #file.dat \u0026lt;- url(\u0026quot;https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/30823824/dat_Genes.txt\u0026quot;) file.dat \u0026lt;- \u0026quot;data_table.tsv\u0026quot; dat \u0026lt;- read.delim(file.dat, header=TRUE, stringsAsFactors=FALSE) str(dat) ## 'data.frame': 37 obs. of 2 variables: ## $ SampleID: chr \u0026quot;T-01\u0026quot; \u0026quot;T-02\u0026quot; \u0026quot;T-03\u0026quot; \u0026quot;T-04\u0026quot; ... ## $ Genes : chr \u0026quot;FOXA1:GATA3:XBP1:COX17:KATNAL1:SCO2:STAT6:TFF3:THY1\u0026quot; \u0026quot;AR:NCOA3:SPDEF:TFF1:XBP1\u0026quot; \u0026quot;AR:FOXA1:MAP3K1:SP1:VAV3\u0026quot; \u0026quot;ESR1:LRBA:UBC:XBP1:ZFYVE16\u0026quot; ...
