My main interest lies in the development and application of computational tools to enable precision medicine in cancer. I use machine learning and statistical techniques to understand the genetic basis of cancer. I develop different computational tools/methods to integrate multi-omics data generated from individual patient. For this, I believe  network based approaches are the best way to study the multi-layered information in a patient. My primary focus is on exploring this idea to prioritize driver genes or modules (group of interconnected genes) of cancer exploiting the genotype-phenotype relationships in cancer patients. Most recently, Iâ€™ve been focusing on developing computational tools to predict therapeutics that target the drivers of cancer. My other research interests lies in cancer biomarker discovery using multi-omics data.",
