I work in Laboratory for Advanced Genome Analysis (LAGA) stationed at [The Vancouver Prostate Center (VPC)]{http://www.prostatecentre.com/} and working in conjunction with [Lab for Computational Biology] {http://compbio.cs.sfu.ca/} at Simon Fraser University. \r\n\r\n### Research Interest\r\nI like to understand the biological problems behind a complex disease, interpret the problem in a mathematical language and provide a computational solution to the problem. My main interest lies in the development and application of computational tools to enable precision medicine in cancer. I use machine learning and statistical techniques to understand the genetic basis of cancer. I develop different computational tools/methods to integrate multi-omics data generated from individual patient. For this, I believe  network based approaches are the best way to study the multi-layered information in a patient. My primary focus is on exploring this idea to prioritize driver genes or modules (group of interconnected genes) of cancer exploiting the genotype-phenotype relationships in cancer patients. Most recently, I’ve been focusing on developing computational tools to predict therapeutics that target the drivers of cancer. My other research interests lies in cancer biomarker discovery using multi-omics data.",
